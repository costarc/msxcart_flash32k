Jumpers in J1 (from top to bottom):
---- CS1
---- CS2
---- CS12
---- /WR
---- A14
---- A15


To write the EEPROM


Download the programmer AT28C256.COM from github repository and save it to your MSX disk.

Note: If any of the chip select jumpers are closed, the MSX will boot from the EEPROM.
To re-write the EEPROM, therefore you must remove those jumpers (CS1,CS2,CS12).

Follow this process:
1. Remove CS1,CS2,CS12 (either that is connected)
2. Put on jumpers WR, A15
3. Boot the MSX with the EEPROM cart inserted in the MSX slot
4. Put on the jumper CS12

Now you ready to write the ROM. 
Try to identify the slot where the cartridge is connected passig parameter "/i" to AT28C256.COM.
Slots with high numbers, such as 82,83, etc are probably form your MSX extended ROMs - you cannot use these values with AT28C256.COM.

Write the ROM passing the correct slot number in the "/s" parameter, for example: at28c256 /s 1 /f roadfighter.rom)
The progress is shown in the screen, and it should take only a few seconds to complete.

To boot from the EEPROM, just reboot the MSX. If you burned 2 ROMs, you can switch between them by moving the jumper between A15 and A14.

You can join two ROMS to make a single ROM to write to the EEPROM. In a Linux or Mac OS system, this command will do the trick:

cat game1.rom >  big.rom
cat game2.rom >> big.rom

For a Windows/DOS system, you should use something like this:
copy /b game1.rom+game2.rom big.rom
