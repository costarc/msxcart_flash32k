Jumpers:

---- A14
---- A15


To write the EEPROM


Download the programmer AT28C256.COM from github repository and save it to your MSX disk.

To write the EEPROM follow these steps:

1. Open /SLTSL (remove jumper)
3. Boot the MSX with the EEPROM cart inserted in the MSX slot
4. Close /SLTSL and A15 (put the jumpers back on)

The MSX slots available to connect cartridges are usually 1 or 2.

AT28C256.COM /i can display your slots, and the initial header in each ROM segment. It might be useful in identifying where the eprom is connected in case you do not know.


Write the ROM to the EEPROM by passing the correct slot number in the "/s" parameter, for example: 

at28c256 /s 1 /f roadfighter.rom

The progress is shown in the screen, and it should take only a few seconds to complete.

To boot from the EEPROM, just reboot the MSX. If you burned 2 ROMs, you can switch between them by moving the jumper between A15 and A14.

You can merge two ROMS to make a single ROM to write to the EEPROM. In a Linux or Mac OS system, this command will do the trick:

cat game1.rom >  big.rom
cat game2.rom >> big.rom

For a Windows/DOS system, you should use something like this:
copy /b game1.rom+game2.rom big.rom
